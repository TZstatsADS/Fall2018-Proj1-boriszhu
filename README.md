### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: A study of HAPPINESS  
+ This project is conducted by Kehui Zhu (kz2293).

+ Project summary: In this project, I explore the text data from HappyDB, "a ccorpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments", to gain deeper insights in how do people define their own happiness. By using different text mining tools, I want to transfer the abstract terminology "happiness" into concrete events or things, with the help of R programming language. 

For example, how do people of different sex value their happiness? Would type of happiness change as people get married? How would age play a role in happiness? We will use text mining tools and data visualization to help us gain some insights into "Happiness".
